Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at WashU Olin Business School. My research interests include AI for finance, empirical asset pricing, investment strategies, asset management, and high-frequency finance. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Asaf Manela](https://asafmanela.github.io/) and Prof. [Guofu Zhou](https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/zhou/).

My research tries to understand the broad picture of the financial market and institutions: how expected returns vary over business cycles and across different assets, how holdings and volumes change in response to the market environment, and how heterogeneity in investors' belief plays out in trading and price formation.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
   
   In this paper, I present the first comprehensive, around-the-clock analysis of systematic jump risk by combining high-frequency market data with contemporaneous news narratives identified as the underlying causes of market jumps. These narratives are retrieved and classified using a state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLM. Decomposing market risk into interpretable jump categories reveals significant heterogeneity in risk premia, with macroeconomic news commanding the largest and most persistent premium. Leveraging this insight, I construct an annually rebalanced real-time Fama-MacBeth factor-mimicking portfolio that isolates the most strongly priced jump risk, achieving a high out-of-sample Sharpe ratio and delivering significant alphas relative to standard factor models. The results highlight the value of around-the-clock analysis and LLM-based narrative understanding for identifying and managing priced risks in real time.
